# Surfs_Up

## Overview of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to examine climate data for the months of June and December in order to determine whether our surf and ice cream shop business is stustainable year-round. 

## Results

- In June the average temperature was approximately 75 degrees, with a minimum of 64 degrees and a maximum temperature of 85 degrees. 
- In December the average temperature was approximately 71 degrees, with a minimum of 56 degrees and a maximum of 83 degrees. 
- In the plots below, we can see that the for the month of June the temperatures tend to cluster within 70 to 80 degrees, which we generally could consider as pleasant temperatures, not too hot to encourage high demand for ice cream but warm enough for ocean activities to take place.
- For contrast, in the month of December, temperature tend to cluster between 67-68 degrees and 75 degrees, which is slightly consider but not significantly so as to have a major impact on demand. However, as noted above the minimum temperature for December was 56 degrees, and there were a few days where the temperature was below 65 degrees which may be deemed too cold for ice cream or to participate in ocean activities.
